# Text-based Adventure - Escape From Cave

You wake suddenly and find yourself in a cave.
There is darkness all over, what will you do?

Text-based adventure game written in Python, using basic coding constructs.
I recommend anyone who is just starting or has started using Github should look it up and start Contributing.

This game uses loops, conditions, objects, strings and some basic python data structures like lists and ordered dictionarys.
You will also get to read someone else's code which will help you in your future.

Also if you are a newbie and want to start contributing on Github , then I would strongly recommend you start with this project.

So come join me in expanding this project and making it bigger and better.

And as always suggestions and questions are always welcome.
